    """gRPC backend transport for AutoMl.

    AutoML Server API.

    The resource names are assigned by the server. The server never
    reuses names that it has created after the resources with those
    names are deleted.

    An ID of a resource is the last element of the item's resource name.
    For
    ``projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/datasets/{dataset_id}``,
    then the id for the item is ``{dataset_id}``.

    Currently the only supported ``location_id`` is "us-central1".

    On any input that is documented to expect a string parameter in
    snake_case or kebab-case, either of those cases is accepted.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.
